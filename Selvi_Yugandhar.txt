Day 1 (19/07/2024)

Taluk office - class
rooms - methods/functions

Reception related things(table, phone, receptionist, computer) - static - belongs to the class

Paper, pen, water can, water bottle, table, chairs, chalan - anyone can access - public
Receptionist mobile, person's mobile/money/bike - private
Documents - protected

Access Modifier - public, private, protected and default

Variables
    10 people/chair/table or 20 people/chair/table or 5 people/chair/table
	- (10, 20 and 5)- variable values
	- people/chair/table - type- datatype
	- red table, red chairs or white chairs - naming - variable name

chair red = 30;
	Chair - datatype
	red - variable name 
	30 - variable value 
public chair red = 20;
private chair red = 2; 

VARIABLE COMMON SYNTAX 
	accessModifer datatype variableName = variableValue;


Method - room
	* Whatever happens inside is not visible to outside or other methods/rooms
	* We can bring things from reception/hall to a method
	* But we can not bring a thing from method/room to outside. In order to do that, we need to follow a process
		- RETURN TYPE
	* Most of the time method wont give us anything - VOID

METHOD COMMON SYNTAX 
	- AccessModifer returnType methodName() { }
	- public void incomeTaxCertificateProcess() {
		
		}

Taluk office - Class

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

* Class - It does a set of work. It consist of variables and methods. Each work would be done by methods. 

* Methods - It does specific job. It always written inside a class

* Variable - it can have type(Data type) and posses a number or name;
			variables can have different access - access Modifier
			
* Access Modifier - defines where we can use a variable/method/class

* Interface - It contains rules most of the time. Sometimes it does some work too(means method).
			Interface is always followed by class/classes. 
			When class follows interface, class should do the rule written in the interfacebject

* package - contains class/classes/interface/interfaces/file/files/folder/folders

* Project - consist of package/packages/file/files/folder/folders/source(src)folder

* static - static means belongs to the class. If govt hospital is class, then hospital receptionist is a static member of that class. 
We can not seperate them variables and methods can be static
			within a class - static can be used anywhere directly (in a static method or in non-static method)
			Outside class - static can be used but alone with class name. (in a static method or in non-static method)

* Object (instantiation or initiation)  - E.g: Medical camp; 
			We create Object only for classes; Whenever we create object we copy whatever the class contains(except static)
			means, only non-static is copied
			Through object we can not call static things.

* Constructor - Object creation happens with the help of constructor
				constructor is available in different kind
				1. without any money/permission
				2. only with money
				3. only with permission
				4. with both money and permission


*************************************************************

Day 4 (21/07/2024)

Git basics

* helps to work on a same file by multiple person. 
* SCM - Source code management 

Original project is in our system, we use Eclipse to view and edit the project in easy manner

Git Repository - Repo- Remote - Remote project

1) Create a Java project 
2) Add some packages and classes and some files 
3) In github.com, create a repository
4) In File explorer, go to your Java project 
5) From there open git bash andd type below commands
	* git init -- it will create a local git with master branch
	* git add .
	* git commit -m "some messages"
	* git remote add origin "repository's SSH path" - we are introducing online repository to local git 
	* git push origin master
	* git status
	
	* git config --global user.email "";
	
	
**********************************************************
Day 5 (22/07/2024)

Maven - Dependencies management tool

	* Difficulties in adding a .jar file into our project
	* .M2 folder stores the dependencies added in pom.xml file
	* Maven projects gives us a proper project structure
	
resolution:-
	* Instead of Java project, create a maven project
	* All maven project consist pom.xml file
	* In pom.xml file, we add the required dependencies
		* groupId
		* artifactId
		* version
		* scope (optional)
	* Eg:-
		OnePlus - GroupID 
		Mobile - ArtifactID
		OnePlus11R - Version
	* Eg:-
		GroupID - selenium.org
		ArtifactID - selenium-java
		version - 4.20.1
		
* Home work
	* Create Maven project
	* push to git repo using git bash
	* delete project from your system
	* By using eclipse import the project directly from git(without RSA)
	* Add RSA and then import directly from git
	* Download the project from 
		* https://github.com/SathiyamoorthiMurugesan/ABC
		* Import this project into eclipse
		
************************************************************************************

Day 6 (23/07/2024)
		
Different ways to import a maven project into Eclipse 
	* clone the project using git bash and import the existing project into Eclipse 
	* clone the project using eclipse and followed by import the existing project into Eclipse
	* clone the project in git perspective and import the existing project into Eclipse
	* download the project into your local and import the existing project into Eclipse
	
* What is .gitignore file and how it works 

* How to access build path of a project

* How and why to update the maven project

* Run as 
	* Maven clean
	* Maven install
	
* In src/main/java
	* We keep development related files
* In src/main/resources
	* We keep utility files which is being used in development files
* In src/test/java
	* We keep test case files
* In src/test/resources
	* We keep utility files which is being used in test cases

* Create a Maven project, push it into Git and add collaborators

************************************************************************************

Day 7 (24/07/2024)

Class - important thing, through which we perform some task. Class may contains methods and variables

Method1 - A work
Method2 - B work
Method3 - C work ( A work + some other work = method1 + some other work)

redundant - repeatable 
reuse
No. of line will reduce 

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Variables

Variables - shape and count/name
shape - datatype 



Syntax:-
	AccessModifier datatype variableName = variableValue
	public int a = 10;
	private String b = "xyz";
	
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Datatype: Its a classification of a data, which tells the compiler or interpreter 
about how the programmer intends to use the data.

1) Primitive
	a) boolean - yes or no OR true or false 
		* boolean aa = true; --> Variable declared and initialized
		* boolean ab;  --> Variable declared but not initiated.
			- default value will be assigned to ab is "false";
	
	b) Textual 
		1) char - a, b, c, A, B
			* char ba = 'a';
			* char bb = '1';
			* default value of char is null;
		2) byte - 
			byte x = 10;
	c) numeric 
		1) int 
			* int cc = 10;
			* default value = 0;
		2) short
			* short dd = 20;
			* default value = 0;
		3) double
			* double ee = 30d;
			* default value = 0;
		4) long
			* long ff = 20l;
			* default value = 0;
		5) float
			* float gg = 2.5f;
			* default value = 0;

2) Non Primitive
	d) String - In java, String is a Non-Primitive data type but at the same time its a Class.
		* String hh = "aA10@";
		* String ii = "In java, String is a Non-Primitive data type but at the same time its a Class.";
		* String jj = "null";
		* default = null;
	e) array
	
int a; - declare
a = 10; - define/initiate/assign
int a = 10 - declare and initiate

int a = 10;
int - data type( primitive --> numeric)
a - variable/variableName;
10 - value posses by the variable/ value pointed by the variable

If you want 10, you need to call 'a' only. 

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&


Variables - Its a memory location that can hold values of a specific datatype.

Types of variables 
1. Local variable - 
	* Datatype declared/initiated within a method/constructor, for, if    -- block ({...})
	* scope of local variable is only within the block in which the variable is declared
	* initialization of local variable is mandatory
	* local variables can not be static
	{
	int a = 10;
	char c;
	c = '2';
	String sathya = "10";
	static int b = 10; -- we can not create like this.
	}
	
2. Instance variable/class variable/non-static variable
	* Declared within a class but outside of a block ({...})
	* Non- static variables
	* To access instance variables, we need to create object for that class
	
	classA {
	int a = 10; //class level non static variable
	String sathya = "10"; //class level non static variable
	
	method1() {
	int  aa = 10; // local variable
	
	sysout(sathya); // we can not use a non static like this. we need to create object
	// it should be written as 
	ClassA obj = new ClassA(); //object creation
	sysout(obj.a);
	}
	
	}
	
	
3. static variable
	* Declared within a class but outside of a block with "static" keyword
	* static keyword is used with variables and methods
	* To access this variable, dont need to create an object
	* within a class - static can be used anywhere directly (in a static method or in non-static method)
	* Outside class - static can be used but along with class name. (in a static method or in non-static method)
	
	static int a = 10;
	static String sathya = "10";
	public static int c = 200;
	
ClassA (TalukOffice) {

static int a = 10;
//a = receptionist;

method1() {
	print (a);
}

}


ClassB (Govt hospital) {

method2() {
print (ClassA.a);
//print (TalukOffice.receptionist)
}
